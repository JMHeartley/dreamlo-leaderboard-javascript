## üë®‚Äçüîß Examples
Using dreamlo.js for your game's leaderboard? Send me a message with a link and I'll add it to the examples listed below:
+ [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/JMHeartley/Tic-Tac-Toe)



## ‚öôÔ∏è Demo
Are you new to dreamlo? Want to test it out without having to commit? üòï

Just use the Swagger UI-like [demo page](https://JMHeartley.github.io/dreamlo.js/) to test requests and retrieve leaderboard data üòé



## üî© Requirements
Go to [dreamlo's official website](https://dreamlo.com/) for a unique pair of public and private keys. **Bookmark your leaderboard's page, you won't be given the URL after the first time!**

If you can afford it, I recommend upgrading your leaderboard, which:
+ üîí enables HTTPS for your board's URL
+ üôå removes the limit of 25 scores



## üîß Installation
There are a few ways to start working, all of which globally expose the `dreamlo` variable:
1. Manually download the compiled file `dreamlo.js` from [dist](/dist) to your appropriate project folder and load using a relative path:
```html
<script src="/path/to/dreamlo.js"></script>
```
2. Use `<script>` to reference the code through [jsDelivr's CDN](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/dreamlo.js):
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/dreamlo.js@1.0.1/dist/dreamlo.min.js"></script>
```
3. Install the [package via npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dreamlo.js) with the following command:
```bash
npm install dreamlo.js
```



## ü§ñ Usage
The methods below, except `initialize()`, are all [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/javascript/reference/global_objects/promise), so they wait for the HTTP response. You'd call these methods like:
```javascript
dreamlo.getScores()
    .then((scores) => {
      // do stuff with scores
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      // do something with error
    });
```

### initiailize
```javascript
dreamlo.initialize(publicKey, privateKey, useHttps)
```
The `initialize` function sets the public and private keys and specifies whether the base URL uses HTTP or HTTPS protocol. Call this method before any others.
+ `publicKey`: the public key of your leaderboard
+ `privateKey`: the private key of your leaderboard
+ `useHttps`: toggles HTTP or HTTPS on the base URL (default: `false`)

### getScore
```javascript
dreamlo.getScore(name, format)
```
The `getScore` function sends a request for one score and returns it in the desired format as a `string`.
+ `name`: the name value of the score to request
+ `format`: the format type of the returned score (default format: `Object`; see [Formats](#score-formats) for all available types)

### getScores
```javascript
dreamlo.getScores(format, sortOrder, skip, take)
```
The `getScores` function sends a request for multiple scores and returns them in desired order and format as a `string`.

+ `format`: the format type of the returned score (default format: `Object[]`; see [Formats](#score-formats) for all available types)
+ `sortOrder`: the sorting order of the retrieved scores (default order: Descending by Points; see [Sorting Order](#sorting-order) for all available orders)
+ `skip`: the score rank you want to start sorting at (default: `0`; zero-based index)
+ `take`: the number of scores you want to retrieve (exclude to retrieve all scores)

*All parameters are optional or have default values; calling with no parameters will return all scores, sorted by points in descending order, as a JSON string.*

### addScore
```javascript
dreamlo.addScore(score, format, sortOrder, canOverwrite)
```
The `addScore` function sends a request to add a score to the leaderboard and returns all scores in desired order and format as a `string`.

+ `score`: the score to add to the leaderboard (see [Score](#score) for the expected shape of this object)
+ `format`: the format type of the returned score (default format: `Object[]`; see [Formats](#score-formats) for all available types)
+ `sortOrder`: the sorting order of the retrieved scores (default order: Descending by Points; see [Sorting Order](#sorting-order) for all available orders)
+ `canOverwrite`: when set to `true`, adding a `score` where the `score.name` is already present on the leaderboard will persist the score with higher `score.points`; when set to `false`, an error is thrown if an overwrite is attempted (default: `false`)

### deleteScore
```javascript
dreamlo.deleteScore(name)
```
The `deleteScore` function sends a request to to delete one score from the leaderboard.
+ `name`: the name value of the score to delete

### deleteScores
```javascript
dreamlo.deleteScores()
```
The `deleteScores` function sends a request to delete all scores from the leaderboard.

### Score
The `score` object represents one score on the leaderboard and has the following properties:
```javascript
{
    name: string;
    points: number;
    seconds: number;    //optional
    text: string;       //optional
}
```
dreamlo doesn't allow the use of the asterisk character ( * ); all occurrences will be replaced by the underscore character ( _ ).

*See [Score](/src/score.ts) for this Typescript interface.*

### Score Formats
The format type of scores returned from the leaderboard can be specified using the following properties:
Format            | Property
------------------| ------------
Javascript Object | `dreamLo.ScoreFormat.Object`
JSON              | `dreamlo.ScoreFormat.Json`
XML               | `dreamlo.ScoreFormat.Xml`
Pipe-delimited    | `dreamlo.ScoreFormat.Pipe`
Quoted with comma | `dreamlo.ScoreFormat.Quote`

`Object` returns an array of scores for `addScore` and `getScores`, and a single score object for `getScore`. The remainder of the formats return scores nested within `dreamlo.leaderboard.entries`.

Scores returned have the same properties as the `score` object, plus an additional `date` property that contains the timestamp when the score was updated.

*See [ScoreFormat](/src/scoreFormat.ts) for this Typescript enum.*

### Sorting Order
The sorting order of scores returned from the leaderboard can be specified using the following properties: 
Order                 | Property
--------------------- | ------------
Descending by Points  | `dreamlo.SortOrder.PointsDescending`
Ascending by Points   | `dreamlo.SortOrder.PointsAscending`
Descending by Seconds | `dreamlo.SortOrder.SecondsDescending`
Ascending by Seconds  | `dreamlo.SortOrder.SecondsAscending`
Descending by Date    | `dreamlo.SortOrder.DateDescending`
Ascending by Date     | `dreamlo.SortOrder.DateAscending`

*See [SortOrder](/src/sortOrder.ts) for this Typescript enum.*



## ü§î About
### What is dreamlo?
dreamlo is a cloud server for hosting leaderboards for game developers.
Out of love for Unity, Carmine Guida started hosting dreamlo. He created [an asset](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/dreamlo-com-free-instant-leaderboards-and-promocode-system-3862)
for the game engine so anyone can effortlessly add a leaderboard to their games.

*Check out [dreamlo's official FAQs page](https://www.dreamlo.com/faq) for more info.*

### Why use dreamlo with Javascript?
Previously, I used the dreamlo game asset for [the game my team built for the GTMK 2020 game jam.](https://github.com/JMHeartley/Work-With-Me-Here)

Years later, I started sprucing up [an old TicTacToe game I made years ago](https://github.com/JMHeartley/TicTacToe)
and wanted to add a leaderboard. The first thing that came to mind was dreamlo, but there was a problem, the script for dreamlo that comes with the Unity game asset was written in C#.

I created this script because any game that can make HTTP requests can use dreamlo. Happily, I've extended Carmine's original dream(lo) to Javascript üòä
