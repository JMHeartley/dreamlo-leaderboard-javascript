    DreamLo Leaderboard (Javascript)
</h1>
<p align="center">
  <i>A Javascript library for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting scores on your DreamLo leaderboard via its web API.</i>
</p>



## üî© Requirements
Go to [DreamLo's offical website](https://dreamlo.com/) to get a unique pair of public and private keys. **Bookmark your leaderboard's page, you won't be given the url after the first time!**

If you can afford it, I recommend upgrading your leaderboard which:
+ üîí enables secure http for your board's url
+ üí™ removes the limit of 25 scores



## üîß Installation
There are a few ways to start working, all of which globally expose the `dreamLo` variable:
1. Manually download the compiled file `dreamlo.js` from [dist](/dist) to your appropriate project folder and load using a relative path:
```html
<script src="/path/to/dreamLo.js"></script>
```
2. Use `<script>` to reference the code through [jsDelivr's CDN](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/dreamlo-leaderboard-javascript):
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/dreamlo-leaderboard-javascript@1.0.0/dist/dreamLo.min.js"></script>
```
3. Install as a package via npm with the following command:
```bash
npm install dreamlo-leaderboard-javascript
```



## ü§ñ Usage
### initiailize
```javascript
dreamLo.initialize(publicKey, privateKey, useHttps)
```
The `initialize` function is used to set public key, private key, and specify whether http or https is being used for the base url. This should be called before any other methods.
+ `publicKey`: the public key of your leaderboard
+ `privateKey`: the private key of your leaderboard
+ `useHttps`: toggles http or https of the base URL (default: `false`)

### getScore
```javascript
dreamLo.getScore(name, format)
```
The `getScore` function is used to get one score as a string. 
+ `name`: the name value of the score to retreive
+ `format`: the format type of the returned score (default: `"json"`; see [Formats](#score-formats) for all available types)

### getScores
```javascript
dreamLo.getScores(format, sortOrder, skip, take)
```
The `getScores` function is used to get multiple scores.

+ `format`: the format type of the returned score (default: `"json"`; see [Formats](#score-formats) for all available types)
+ `sortOrder`: the sorting order of the retreived scores (default: `PointsDescending`; see [Sorting Order](#sorting-order) for all available orders)
+ `skip`: the score rank you want to start sorting at (default: `0`; zero-based index)
+ `take`: the number of scores you want to retrieve (exclude to retrieve all scores)

*All of the parameters are optional or have default values, calling with no parameters will return all scores, sorted by points in descending order, as a JSON string.*

### addScore
```javascript
dreamlo.addScore(score, format, sortOrder)
```
The `addScore` function is used to add a score to the leaderboard.

Adding a `score` where the `score.name` is already present on the leaderboard will overwrite the older score.

+ `score`: the score to add to the leaderboard (see [Score](#score) for the expected shape of this object)
+ `format`: the format type of the returned score (default: `"json"`; see [Formats](#score-formats) for all available types)
+ `sortOrder`: the sorting order of the retreived scores (default: `PointsDescending`; see [Sorting Order](#sorting-order) for all available orders)

### deleteScore
```javascript
dreamLo.deleteScore(name)
```
The `deleteScore` function is used to delete one score from the leaderboard.
+ `name`: the name value of the score to delete

### deleteScores
```javascript
dreamLo.deleteScores()
```
The `deleteScores` function is used to delete all scores from the leaderboard.

### Score
The `score` object represents one score on the leaderboard and has the following properties:
```javascript
{
    name: string;
    points: number;
    seconds: number;    //optional
    text: string;       //optional
}
```

*See [Score](/src/score.ts) for this Typescript interface.*

### Score Formats
The format type of scores returned from the leaderboard can be specified using the following values as a `string`:
Value                          | Format
------------------------------ | ------------
`dreamLo.ScoreFormat["Json"]`  | JSON
`dreamLo.ScoreFormat["Xml"]`   | XML
`dreamLo.ScoreFormat["Pipe"]`  | Pipe-delimited
`dreamLo.ScoreFormat["Quote"]` | Quoted with comma

*See [ScoreFormat](/src/scoreFormat.ts) for this Typescript enum.*

### Sorting Order
The sorting order of scores returned form the leaderboard can be specified using the following values as a `string`: 
Value                             | Order
--------------------------------- | ------------
`SortOrder["PointsDescending"]`   | Descending by Points
`SortOrder["PointsAscending"]`    | Ascending by Points
`SortOrder["SecondsDescending"]`  | Descending by Seconds
`SortOrder["SecondsAscending"]`   | Ascending by Seconds
`SortOrder["DateDescending"]`     | Descending by Date
`SortOrder["DateAscending"]`      | Ascending by Date

*See [SortOrder](/src/sortOrder.ts) for this Typescript enum.*



## ü§î About
### What is DreamLo?
DreamLo is a cloud server for hosting leaderboards for game developers.
Carmine Guida, out of love for the Unity, started hosting DreamLo and created [an asset](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/dreamlo-com-free-instant-leaderboards-and-promocode-system-3862)
for the game engine so anyone can effortlessly add leaderboard to their games.

*Check out [its FAQs page](https://www.dreamlo.com/faq) for more info.*

### Why use DreamLo with Javascript?
Previously, I used the DreamLo game asset for [the game my team built for the GTMK 2020 game jam.](https://github.com/JMHeartley/Work-With-Me-Here)

Years later, I started sprucing up [an old TicTacToe game I made years ago](https://github.com/JMHeartley/TicTacToe)
and wanted to add a leaderboard. The first thing that came to mind was DreamLo but there was a problem, the script for DreamLo that comes with the Unity game asset is written in C#.

I created this script because DreamLo can be used with any game that can make http requests. Happily, I've extended Carmine's original dream(lo) to Javascript.
