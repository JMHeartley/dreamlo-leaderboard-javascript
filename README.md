## üë®‚Äçüîß Examples
Using dreamlo.js for your game's leaderboard? Send me a message with a link and I'll add it to the examples listed below:
+ [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/JMHeartley/Tic-Tac-Toe)



## ‚öôÔ∏è Demo
Are you new to dreamlo? Want to test it out without having to commit? üòï

Just use the [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/)-like [demo page](https://JMHeartley.github.io/dreamlo.js/) to test requests and retrieve leaderboard data üòé



## üî© Requirements
Go to [dreamlo's official website](https://dreamlo.com/) for a unique pair of public and private codes. **Bookmark your leaderboard's page, you won't be given the URL after the first time!**

If you can afford it, I recommend upgrading your leaderboard, which:
+ üîí enables HTTPS for your board's URL
+ üôå removes the limit of 25 scores



## üîß Installation
There are a few ways to start working, all of which globally expose the `dreamlo` variable:
1. Manually download the compiled file `dreamlo.js` from [dist](/dist) to your appropriate project folder and load using a relative path:
```html
<script src="/path/to/dreamlo.js"></script>
```
2. Use `<script>` to reference the code through [jsDelivr's CDN](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/dreamlo.js):
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/dreamlo.js@1.3.2/dist/dreamlo.min.js"></script>
```
3. Install the [package via npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dreamlo.js) with the following command:
```bash
npm install dreamlo.js
```



## ü§ñ Usage
The methods below, except `initialize()`, are all [Promises](https://javascript.info/promise-basics), so they can wait for the HTTP response. Failed HTTP requests will throw an `Error` containing the [HTTP status code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status).

You can use these methods with [Promise chains](https://javascript.info/promise-chaining):

```javascript
dreamlo.getScores()
    .then((scores) => {
      // do stuff with scores
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      // do something with error
    });
```

or [async/await](https://javascript.info/async-await):

```javascript
try {
  var scores = await dreamlo.getScores();
  // do stuff with scores
} catch (error) {
  // do something with error
}
```

### initiailize
```javascript
dreamlo.initialize(publicCode, privateCode, useHttps)
```
The `initialize` function sets the public and private codes and specifies whether the base URL uses HTTP or HTTPS protocol. Call this method before any others.
+ `publicCode`: the public code of your leaderboard
+ `privateCode`: the private code of your leaderboard
+ `useHttps`: toggles HTTP or HTTPS on the base URL (default: `false`)

### getScore
```javascript
dreamlo.getScore(name, format)
```
The `getScore` function sends a request for one leaderboard entry and returns it in the desired format.
+ `name`: the name value of the score to request
+ `format`: the format type of the returned [leaderboard entry](#entry) (default format: `Object`; see [Formats](#score-formats) for which properties are used to change formats)

<details>
<summary>Return behavior by format</summary>

+ `Object`: returns a single entry `object` or `null` if no entries match `score.name`
+ `JSON`: returns a single entry for `getScore` as a `string` or `null` as a `string` if no entries match `score.name`
+ `XML`: returns a single entry for `getScore` as a `string` or an empty `string` if no entries match `score.name`
+ `Pipe`: returns a single entry for `getScore` as a `string` or an empty `string` if no entries match `score.name`
+ `Quote`: returns a single entry for `getScore` as a `string` or an empty `string` if no entries match `score.name`
</details>
<br>

### getScores
```javascript
dreamlo.getScores(format, sortOrder, skip, take)
```
The `getScores` function sends a request for multiple leaderboard entries and returns them in the specified format and order.

+ `format`: the format type of the returned [leaderboard entries](#entry) (default format: `Object`; see [Formats](#score-formats) for which properties are used to change formats)
+ `sortOrder`: the sorting order of the retrieved scores (default order: Descending by Points; see [Sorting Order](#sorting-order) for which properties are used to adjust orders)
+ `skip`: the score rank you want to start sorting at (default: `0`; zero-based index)
+ `take`: the number of scores you want to retrieve (default: `undefined`; retrieves all scores)

<details>
<summary>Return behavior by format</summary>

+ `Object`: returns an array of entry `object`s
+ `JSON`: returns an array of entries nested within `dreamlo.leaderboard.entry` as a `string`
+ `XML`: returns `<entry>`s nested within `<dreamlo><leaderboard></leaderboard></dreamlo>` as a `string` or `"<dreamlo></leaderboard /></dreamlo>"` if no entries are found
+ `Pipe`: returns entries with pipe-delimited values, each entry separated with a new line character as a `string` or an empty `string` if no entries are found
+ `Quote`: returns entries with double-quoted values, separated with a comma, each entry with a new line character as a `string` or an empty `string` if no entries are found

</details>
<br>

*All parameters are optional or have default values; calling with no parameters will return all scores, sorted by points in descending order, as an array of objects.*

### addScore
```javascript
dreamlo.addScore(score, format, sortOrder, canOverwrite)
```
The `addScore` function sends a request to add a score to the leaderboard and returns all leaderboard entries in the specified format and order.

+ `score`: the score to add to the leaderboard (see [Score](#score) for the expected shape of this object)
+ `format`: the format type of the returned [leaderboard entries](#entry) (default format: `Object`; see [Formats](#score-formats) for which properties are used to change formats)
+ `sortOrder`: the sorting order of the retrieved scores (default order: Descending by Points; see [Sorting Order](#sorting-order) for which properties are used to adjust orders)
+ `canOverwrite`: when adding a `score` whose `score.name` is already present on the leaderboard, if this is set to `true`, the `score` with higher `score.points` is saved; if set to `false`, an `Error` is thrown (default: `false`)

<details>
<summary>Return behavior by format</summary>

+ `Object`: returns an array of entry `object`s
+ `JSON`: returns an array of entries nested within `dreamlo.leaderboard.entry` as a `string`
+ `XML`: returns `<entry>`s nested within `<dreamlo><leaderboard></leaderboard></dreamlo>` as a `string` or `"<dreamlo></leaderboard /></dreamlo>"` if no entries are found
+ `Pipe`: returns entries with pipe-delimited values, each entry separated with a new line character as a `string` or an empty `string` if no entries are found
+ `Quote`: returns entries with double-quoted values, separated with a comma, each entry with a new line character as a `string` or an empty `string` if no entries are found
</details>
<br>

**TIP:** if updating a score on the leaderboard, set `canOverwrite` to `true`, if adding a new score, set `canOverwrite` to `false`.

### deleteScore
```javascript
dreamlo.deleteScore(name)
```
The `deleteScore` function sends a request to delete one score from the leaderboard.
+ `name`: the name value of the score to delete

### deleteScores
```javascript
dreamlo.deleteScores()
```
The `deleteScores` function sends a request to delete all scores from the leaderboard.

### Score
```javascript
{
    name: string,
    points: number,
    seconds: number,
    text: string
}
```
A `score` is a data object sent to the leaderboard.
+ `name`: the unique identifier for `score`s; instead of using a player's name, try a distinct value, like a [timestamp](https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/javascript/how-to-get-a-timestamp-in-javascript.html)
+ `points`: the first numeric value that can be used to [sort multiple entries](#sorting-order)
+ `seconds`: the second numeric value that can be used to [sort multiple entries](#sorting-order); this property is optional
+ `text`: contains extra data relating to the `score`; this property is optional

**TIP:** if you have lots of extra data you want to store, you can use `score.text` to save a pipe-delimited string and then decode/recode the information in your program.

dreamlo doesn't allow the use of the asterisk character ( * ); all occurrences will be replaced by the underscore character ( _ ).

*See [Score](/src/score.ts) for this Typescript interface.*

### Entry
```javascript
{
    name: string,
    score: string,
    seconds: string,
    text: string,
    date: string
}
```
An entry is a `score` retrieved from the leaderboard. Shown above is what it looks like with the `Object` format; `JSON` and `XML` use properties that have the same names as `Object`. `Pipe` and `Quote` don't use key-value pairs, but values are listed similarly.
+ `name`: correlates to `score.name`
+ `score`: correlates to `score.points`
+ `seconds`: correlates to `score.seconds`
+ `text`: correlates to `score.text`
+ `date`: when the entry was last updated, in [US format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_and_time_notation_in_the_United_States) (`mm-dd-yyyy HH:MM:ss AM/PM`), using the [UTC timezone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time).

### Score Formats
The format type of entries returned from the leaderboard can be specified using the following properties:
Format            | Property
------------------| ------------
Javascript Object | `dreamLo.ScoreFormat.Object`
JSON              | `dreamlo.ScoreFormat.Json`
XML               | `dreamlo.ScoreFormat.Xml`
Pipe-delimited    | `dreamlo.ScoreFormat.Pipe`
Quoted with comma | `dreamlo.ScoreFormat.Quote`

*See [ScoreFormat](/src/scoreFormat.ts) for this Typescript enum.*

### Sorting Order
The sorting order of entries returned from the leaderboard can be specified using the following properties: 
Order                 | Property
--------------------- | ------------
Descending by Points  | `dreamlo.SortOrder.PointsDescending`
Ascending by Points   | `dreamlo.SortOrder.PointsAscending`
Descending by Seconds | `dreamlo.SortOrder.SecondsDescending`
Ascending by Seconds  | `dreamlo.SortOrder.SecondsAscending`
Descending by Date    | `dreamlo.SortOrder.DateDescending`
Ascending by Date     | `dreamlo.SortOrder.DateAscending`

*See [SortOrder](/src/sortOrder.ts) for this Typescript enum.*



## ü§î About
### What is dreamlo?
dreamlo is a cloud server for hosting leaderboards for game developers.
Out of love for Unity, Carmine Guida started hosting dreamlo. He created [an asset](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/dreamlo-com-free-instant-leaderboards-and-promocode-system-3862)
for the game engine so anyone can effortlessly add a leaderboard to their games.

*Check out [dreamlo's official FAQs page](https://www.dreamlo.com/faq) for more info.*

### Why use dreamlo with Javascript?
Previously, I used the dreamlo game asset for [the game my team built for the GTMK 2020 game jam.](https://github.com/JMHeartley/Work-With-Me-Here)

Years later, I started sprucing up [an old TicTacToe game I made years ago](https://github.com/JMHeartley/TicTacToe)
and wanted to add a leaderboard. The first thing that came to mind was dreamlo, but there was a problem: the script for dreamlo that comes with the Unity game asset was written in C#.

I created this script because any game that can make HTTP requests can use dreamlo. Happily, I've extended Carmine's original dream(lo) to Javascript üòä
